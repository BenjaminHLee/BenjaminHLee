### Hello!

Hey, I'm Ben!
I'm a student at Brown University interested in many things, including programming languages, 
systems, computer science education, cities, handwriting, tool-building, and more. 

I like building tools. If you've got questions about something I've worked on, 
feel free to send me a message.

You can reach me via email at benjaminlee@brown.edu, or on LinkedIn at
